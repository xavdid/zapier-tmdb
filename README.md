# zapier-tmdb

A personal app to wrap my [tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en) code in a convenient package. 

Built using [Zapier's](https://zapier.com) [CLI platform](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-cli)

If you'd like access to it, please open an issue. It's still pretty alpha (built for my exact use case) but we can make something work.
